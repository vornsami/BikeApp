### Information

Bikeapp is a viewer for Helsinki city bike travel data. It is implemented through a java-based backend server and a react-based frontend.

### How to use

Data files are placed in a csv directory located in the same directory as the backend is running in.
If you are running the app through source code, place the directory in the /backend directory.

If running through a docker-container, place the directory here.

The name of the directory should be "csv".
